# Intelligent Algorithm Selection for Recommender Systems: Meta-Learning via in-depth algorithm feature Engineering


## Requirements

To install all necessary packages, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Pipeline execution
The experimental pipeline is controlled via `scripts/run_pipeline.py`. 
It consists of three seperate functions: ground-truth-generation, user and algorithm feature generation and meta-learning evaluation
1. Ground truth generation
2. User and algorithm feature generation
3. Meta-Learner training and evaluation

You can execute the entire pipeline from start to finish, or run specific steps by editing the main function at the bottom of the script.

**Note:** The full pipeline, especially the ground truth generation, can take several hours to complete.

## Feature Importance Experiment
To run the feature importance analysis, execute `scripts/feature_importance_analysis.py`


## Data

**Please Note:** Due to file size limitations, the raw datasets are not included in this repository.

### Data Setup

1.  Download the required raw datasets (e.g., MovieLens-1M, LastFM, etc.) from their original sources.
2.  Create a subdirectory for each dataset inside `/data/raw/`.
3.  Place the unzipped data files into their corresponding directories. The final structure should look like this:

    ```
    data/
    └── raw/
        ├── ml-1m/
        │   └── ratings.dat
        ├── lastfm/
        │   └── user_artists.dat
        ├── bookcrossing/
        │   └── BX-Book-Ratings.csv
        └── ... (and so on for the other datasets)
    ```
Then, run `data/preprocess.py` to run the preprocessing functions for all datasets.

Alternatively, you can find the already preprocessed datasets here: https://1drv.ms/f/c/04375478f480c0d7/Ep5MxuIkl5pIoJ8T-Jc1nG8BYtoZDFX-Zs_03jHhbjmgCQ?e=xP4cgf


### Data Flow

-   **Raw Datasets:** Must be placed in `/data/raw/<dataset_name>/` as described above.
-   **Processed Datasets:** Generated by `data/preprocess.py` and stored in `/data/processed/`.
-   **Ground Truth & User Features:** Generated by the pipeline and stored in `/results/meta_learning_data/`.
-   **Algorithm Features:** Generated by the pipeline and stored in `/results/algo_features/`.
-   **Conceptual Algorithm Features:** These are an exception, as they are not automatically generated but created manually. They are included in the repository.
-   **Final Analysis:** Summary tables and plots are saved to `/results/meta_learning_analysis/`.
